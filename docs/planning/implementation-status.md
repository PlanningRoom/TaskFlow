# TaskFlow — Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-09
**Current Phase:** Phase D1 — Real-Time / WebSocket (next)
**Plan:** [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md)

---

## How to Use This File

This file mirrors the phases and tasks defined in `implementation-plan.md`. As work proceeds:

- Update each task's checkbox as it is completed.
- Update each phase's status header (`Not started` → `In progress` → `Complete` / `Blocked`).
- Update the **Last Updated**, **Current Phase**, and the **Progress Summary** table at the top of each session.
- For blocked phases, note the blocker on the phase line (e.g., `[!] Blocked — waiting on X`).
- Open Items from §6.4 of the plan are tracked at the bottom — confirm each one before its consuming phase begins.

Refer to the implementation plan for the goal, definition of done, and references for each phase.

## Open Items to Confirm Before Their Phase

These were surfaced during plan validation (§6.4 of the implementation plan). Resolve each before its consuming phase begins.

- [x] **Open Item #1 (before C4):** Comment edit/delete scope — default decision is "author only". Record as ADR or confirm. **Resolved 2026-05-09 with [ADR 088](../technical/decisions/088-comment-edit-delete-scope.md): author-only edit/delete; admins/owners cannot mutate other users' comments.**
- [ ] **Open Item #2 (before G8):** Email change in profile — default is "not exposed in v1". Confirm with PRD revision.
- [ ] **Open Item #3 (before G8):** Last-used view per project storage — default is `localStorage`.
- [ ] **Open Item #4 (before G3):** Project activity feed surface — default is side panel reachable from sub-nav. Confirm with design.
- [ ] **Open Item #5 (before H2):** First-run prompt logic — default derives from workspace state (no backend flag). Confirm.

## Notes

Use this section as a running log of decisions, blockers, or context that should persist across sessions.

### 2026-05-02 — Phase 0 complete

- Monorepo scaffolded: `apps/{api,web}`, `packages/{api-types,config}`, `infra/{cloudformation,nginx,ec2}`, `.github/workflows`.
- Biome 1.9.4 (TS/JS) and Ruff 0.7.0 (Python) configured. Biome ignore list excludes `apps/api/`, `infra/`, `docs/`, `episodes/` so it does not lint Python or vendored content.
- Python 3.12 backend uses `pyproject.toml` with hatchling and a placeholder FastAPI app exposing `GET /health` so Phase B1 can grow it without restructuring.
- Both `apps/api/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Dockerfile` pin `--platform=linux/arm64` per ADR 038. Web Dockerfile is multi-stage (node build → nginx serve).
- `docker-compose.yml` includes db (Postgres 16), MailHog, api, web. `make dev` runs `bootstrap` first to copy `.env.example → .env.local` if absent.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` is a deliberate placeholder; full topology lands in Phase I2.
- README updated with a "Building TaskFlow Locally" section while preserving the existing methodology content for the YouTube series.

#### Discrepancy review and reconciliation (same day)

A post-Phase-0 audit against the ADRs surfaced 9 issues; all are now fixed:

1. **ADR 082 pre-commit split.** Husky 9.1.6 + lint-staged 15.2.10 run Biome on staged `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.json`. The `pre-commit` framework runs Ruff on Python and `detect-secrets` on staged content. The Biome hook was removed from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The `.husky/pre-commit` script invokes both pipelines.
2. **ADR 086 CodeQL trigger.** Reduced to weekly cron + `workflow_dispatch` only; PR / push triggers removed.
3. **ADR 086 Dependabot scope.** Trimmed to npm + pip only (github-actions and docker ecosystems dropped).
4. **TDD §4 `ruff.toml`.** Removed from the directory tree; replaced with a comment that Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` per ADR 078. `uv.lock` added to the same line.
5. **TDD §4 `tests/{unit,integration}` subdirs.** Created with empty `__init__.py`.
6. **TDD §4 `alembic.ini`.** Intentionally deferred to Phase B1; not a Phase 0 obligation.
7. **uv dependency management.** `apps/api/pyproject.toml` declares `[tool.uv]`; `apps/api/uv.lock` is committed (49 packages resolved). `Dockerfile` uses the pinned `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.4` image and runs `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`. CI workflow uses `astral-sh/setup-uv@v3` and `uv run …` for Ruff and mypy. `make install` and `make lock` added.
8. **Biome shared base in `packages/config`.** `packages/config/biome.base.json` holds formatter/linter rules; root `biome.json` uses `"extends": ["./packages/config/biome.base.json"]` and keeps only the workspace-specific `vcs` and `files.ignore` blocks. `@taskflow/config` package exports the base config.
9. **`.env.example` completeness.** Added `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`, CORS allowlist, full `slowapi` rate-limit knobs (ADR 052), SES region + from-name (ADR 067), S3 backup + source-maps bucket names (ADR 074), `CERTBOT_EMAIL`, and `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`.

#### Cross-document edits made for consistency

- `docs/planning/implementation-plan.md` — Phase 0 task list updated: Biome task now reads "root `biome.json` extends `packages/config/biome.base.json`"; Python deps task now says "manage deps with `uv` (lockfile committed at `apps/api/uv.lock`)"; pre-commit task now reads "Husky + lint-staged for Biome on staged TS/JS; `pre-commit` framework for Ruff on Python and `detect-secrets`".
- `docs/technical/technical-design-document.md` — §4 directory tree updated to drop `ruff.toml`, annotate `pyproject.toml` as the home of `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.mypy]`, and add `uv.lock`.

#### Verification done in this session

- `pnpm install` succeeds (4 workspace projects, 126 packages added). Husky's `prepare` script wires `core.hooksPath = .husky/_`.
- `pnpm exec biome check .` runs clean across 14 files.
- `cd apps/api && uv lock` resolves 49 packages; `uv sync --frozen` installs cleanly.
- `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, and `uv run mypy taskflow` all green.

#### Runtime verification still TODO

- `make dev` end-to-end boot of the docker-compose stack.
- `pre-commit install` + a synthetic API-key commit to confirm `detect-secrets` blocks.
- A green CI run on a real PR.

### 2026-05-02 — Phase B1 complete

**Files added** (`apps/api/taskflow/`): `main.py`, `settings.py`, `errors.py`, `logging_config.py`, `db/__init__.py`, `db/session.py`, `db/models/__init__.py`, `db/migrations/{env.py,script.py.mako,versions/.gitkeep}`, `api/__init__.py`, `api/v1/__init__.py`. Plus `apps/api/alembic.ini`, `apps/api/tests/conftest.py`, `apps/api/tests/integration/test_skeleton.py`.

**Wire shape:**
- `GET /health` (root) — 200 with `{"status":"ok"}` when `SELECT 1` succeeds, 503 with `{"status":"unhealthy"}` on `SQLAlchemyError`.
- `/api/v1/openapi.json` — FastAPI 0.115 emits OpenAPI 3.1.
- `/api/v1` router mounted, empty (endpoints land in B3+).
- `/api/v1/docs` Swagger UI is exposed in non-prod, suppressed in prod (per ADR 040 / TDD §9.3 "not publicly routed in prod").

**Error envelope (ADR 043 / TDD §9.2):** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "fields"? } }`. `errors.py` defines `AppError` (base, 500) and concrete subclasses `NotFoundError` (404), `PermissionDeniedError` (403), `ConflictError` (409), `RateLimitedError` (429, with `Retry-After`). Three handlers cover `AppError`, `RequestValidationError` (422 with per-field codes), and the catch-all `Exception` (500 opaque envelope, ERROR-level structlog line).

**Logging (ADR 075 / TDD §13.1):** `structlog` with `JSONRenderer` to stdout. `RequestContextMiddleware` is a pure ASGI middleware (not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which interacts badly with FastAPI exception handlers — see starlette#1715). Each request binds `request_id`, `path`, `method` into contextvars; emits a `request` log on success / `request.error` on uncaught middleware-side exceptions, including `duration_ms` and `status`. `X-Request-Id` is honored from the inbound header or generated as a `uuid4().hex`, and echoed on the response.

**Settings:** `pydantic-settings` reads `.env.local` (then `.env`); declares `app_env`, `log_level`, `app_base_url`, `frontend_base_url`, `database_url`, `cors_allowed_origins`. Production-only / B3+ keys are not yet declared in `Settings` — they live in `.env.example` and will be added as later phases consume them.

**DB / Alembic:** `db.session` exposes `engine` (asyncpg, `pool_pre_ping=True`), `SessionFactory`, and `get_db()` async generator dependency. `db.models` defines an empty `DeclarativeBase` (`Base`) — concrete tables come in B2. `alembic.ini` keeps `sqlalchemy.url` empty; `migrations/env.py` reads `settings.database_url` and uses `async_engine_from_config` + `connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)`.

**Tests (`tests/integration/test_skeleton.py`, 10 cases after the reconciliation below):**
- `/health` returns 200 when DB reachable; 503 when SQLAlchemy raises.
- `/api/v1/openapi.json` is a valid 3.1 document and includes `/health`.
- `X-Request-Id` is echoed when sent and generated when absent.
- Per-field validation envelope: wrong type → `INVALID_TYPE`; missing required field → `REQUIRED`.
- App-error envelope on `NotFoundError`, `PermissionDeniedError`, `ConflictError`.
- Unhandled error returns the 500 envelope and emits a single ERROR `request.error` record (with `request_id`, `path`, `method`, `duration_ms`, `exception`) via stdlib log capture.

The DB engine is mocked in `conftest.py` (no Postgres needed for B1). Conftest patches `taskflow.main.{init_engine, get_engine, dispose_engine}` so the lifespan and route share the same fake. The `_test/*` routes are mounted on the live app per-test and torn down after. Tests use `raise_server_exceptions=False` because Starlette's `ServerErrorMiddleware` always re-raises after sending the 500 — a real HTTP client just sees the response, and the test mirrors that.

**Quality gates (run locally):**
- `uv run ruff check .` clean
- `uv run ruff format --check .` clean
- `uv run mypy taskflow tests` — strict, 16 source files, no issues
- `uv run pytest -q` — 10 passed
- `pnpm exec biome check .` clean

**Decisions worth remembering for B2+:**
- Pure ASGI middleware (not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`) is the convention — exception handlers must be the catcher, not user middleware.
- Tests should not define Pydantic models inside fixture function bodies (FastAPI's body-vs-query heuristic gets the wrong namespace). Module-level `BaseModel` subclasses + `Annotated[Model, Body()]` is the safe shape.

#### Discrepancy review and reconciliation (same day)

A post-B1 audit against ADR 043 / 071 / 075 / 082, TDD §7.1 / §9.2 / §9.3 / §13.1, and the implementation-plan tasks surfaced 9 issues. All 9 are now resolved:

1. **ADR 043 canonical validation codes.** `errors.py` now maps Pydantic v2 error `type` strings to canonical SCREAMING_SNAKE codes (`missing → REQUIRED`, `string_type → INVALID_TYPE`, `string_too_short → TOO_SHORT`, `enum → INVALID_CHOICE`, `url_* → INVALID_URL`, `uuid_* → INVALID_UUID`, `datetime_* → INVALID_DATETIME`, `greater_than/less_than/multiple_of → OUT_OF_RANGE`, `value_error → INVALID`, …). Mapping table is committed to `_PYDANTIC_TYPE_TO_CODE` and mirrored in TDD §9.2. New tests assert both `REQUIRED` and `INVALID_TYPE`.
2. **ADR 071 / 082 — pytest in CI.** `ci.yml` gains a `tests` job running `uv run pytest -q` on every PR. Postgres-backed integration tests will land in B2's CI extension.
3. **ADR 075 — stdlib → structlog bridge.** `configure_logging()` now wires `structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory` and a `ProcessorFormatter` so uvicorn / FastAPI / root-logger lines are rendered as JSON to stdout with the same `ts`/`level`/`exception` shape as structlog events. Fixed-list of bridged loggers: `uvicorn`, `uvicorn.error`, `uvicorn.access`, `fastapi`.
4. **TDD §7.1 engine lifecycle.** `db/session.py` no longer creates the engine at module load. New `init_engine()` / `dispose_engine()` / `get_engine()` functions hold the singleton; lifespan calls them on startup / shutdown. TDD §7.1 step 2 reworded accordingly and step 6 split into "registered at import; lifecycle resources only in lifespan."
5. **TDD §9.3 openapi access policy.** TDD §9.3 amended to clarify that nginx (Phase E1 / ADR 083) is the access boundary; FastAPI exposes `/api/v1/openapi.json` unconditionally and suppresses the Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs` when `APP_ENV=production`.
6. **Duplicate ERROR logs on unhandled exceptions.** `unhandled_error_handler` no longer logs — the middleware's `request.error` (with full request context + traceback via `format_exc_info`) is the single ERROR record per failed request. TDD §9.2 documents this.
7. **Plan: mypy in CI.** No code change — already satisfied. The `typecheck` job now also includes `tests` so test files are strict-typechecked too.
8. **ADR 042 — `/health` Pydantic model.** `HealthStatus(BaseModel)` defined; `/health` declares `response_model=HealthStatus`. OpenAPI documents the response shape.
9. **CORS middleware.** `CORSMiddleware` wired from `settings.cors_origins_list` with credentials, the relevant methods, `Content-Type` / `X-CSRF-Token` / `X-Request-Id` headers, and `X-Request-Id` exposed.

#### Cross-document edits made for consistency

- `docs/technical/technical-design-document.md`:
  - §7.1 — startup steps reworded; engine is "initialized" in lifespan via `init_engine()`, disposed via `dispose_engine()`. Routes/middleware register at module import; only lifecycle-managed resources go in lifespan.
  - §9.2 — added the canonical Pydantic-type → code mapping table; documented that the middleware is the single ERROR logger for unhandled exceptions.
  - §9.3 — clarified nginx is the gating boundary in production; FastAPI exposes openapi.json unconditionally and suppresses docs UI in prod.
- `docs/planning/implementation-plan.md` — no further edits required.

#### Verification done in this session

- `uv run ruff check .` clean
- `uv run ruff format --check .` clean
- `uv run mypy taskflow tests` — 16 source files, strict, no issues
- `uv run pytest -q` — 10 passed
- `pnpm exec biome check .` clean

### 2026-05-02 — Phase B2 complete

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/taskflow/db/uuid7.py` — wraps `uuid_utils.uuid7()`, returns stdlib `UUID`.
- `apps/api/taskflow/db/models/{__init__,workspace,user,session,invitation,password_reset_token,project,task,label,comment,activity_event,notification,audit_log}.py` — 14 ORM models on a shared `DeclarativeBase` with a naming convention (`pk_*`, `fk_*`, `ix_*`, `uq_*`, `ck_*`).
- `apps/api/taskflow/db/migrations/versions/0001_initial.py` — hand-edited single migration with all tables, hot-path indexes, CHECK constraints, the partial unique index on `users(workspace_id, lower(email)) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, and the generated `tasks.search_vector` (`setweight A: title || B: description`) plus its GIN index.
- `apps/api/entrypoint.sh` — runs `alembic upgrade head` then exec's the CMD; wired in `Dockerfile` via `ENTRYPOINT`.
- `apps/api/tests/integration/{conftest.py,test_migration_boot.py}` — Postgres-backed fixtures and migration-boot tests.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — added a `tests` job with a Postgres 16 service container; `TEST_DATABASE_URL` env wires the conftest fixture.

**Schema decisions worth remembering:**
- **`citext` not used.** TDD §8.2 lists `email` as `citext`, but adopting it requires `CREATE EXTENSION citext` and a SQLAlchemy type adapter. We use `text` + a `lower(email)` partial unique index instead — same uniqueness semantics, no extension required. (Worth a TDD note.)
- **`tasks.search_vector`** is a stored `GENERATED ALWAYS AS … STORED` column at the DB level; SQLAlchemy uses `Computed(persisted=True)` so autogenerated migrations would round-trip. Tests assert that inserting a task makes `websearch_to_tsquery('english', :q)` find it.
- **JSONB `metadata` columns** are mapped as `metadata_` Python attribute → `metadata` DB column to avoid colliding with SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata` attribute.
- **UUIDv7 via `uuid_utils`.** Python 3.13 will get `uuid.uuid7` natively; the wrapper centralizes the dep.

### 2026-05-02 — Phase B3 complete

**Files added (`apps/api/taskflow/auth/`):** `passwords.py`, `tokens.py`, `sessions.py`, `csrf.py`, `permissions.py`, `dependencies.py`, `audit.py`.

- **Argon2id** (`hash_password`, `verify_password`, `needs_rehash`) with parameters `time_cost=3, memory_cost=65536, parallelism=4` per ADR 048. `verify_password` swallows `VerifyMismatchError` and any malformed-hash exceptions — never leaks via stack trace.
- **Session helpers** (`create_session`, `lookup_session`, `delete_session`, `delete_sessions_for_user`, `cleanup_expired_sessions`). Sessions stored in Postgres (ADR 068) with SHA-256-hashed token IDs; CSRF token bytes stored alongside (ADR 051). 7-day idle / 30-day absolute lifetimes per TDD §11.2 / `settings.session_idle_ttl_days` / `settings.session_absolute_ttl_days`.
- **CSRF double-submit** (`csrf.csrf_check`) — GET/HEAD/OPTIONS pass, mutating methods require cookie + header to match each other AND the session's bound CSRF token. `hmac.compare_digest` for constant-time compare.
- **Permission table** (`auth.permissions`) — `Action` enum + `PERMISSIONS` table that mirrors PRD §2.1 exactly. `is_allowed(role, action)` and `has_implicit_project_access(role)`. Unit-tested cell-by-cell against the PRD.
- **FastAPI dependencies** in `auth/dependencies.py`: `get_db`, `current_session` (refreshes `last_seen_at`, raises 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` on missing/expired/idle), `current_user` (rejects `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` per ADR 065), `current_workspace`, `require_action(Action)` factory, `require_project_access(project_id_param)` factory, `verify_csrf` middleware-style dep.
- **Audit helper** (`auth/audit.write_audit_log`) — synchronous, in-transaction; pulls IP + UA off `Request`. Caller commits.

**Tests added (`apps/api/tests/unit/`):** `test_passwords.py`, `test_csrf.py`, `test_permissions.py`, `test_tokens.py`. All four DB-free; 20 assertions total covering happy paths, mismatches, malformed hashes, and the entire role × action grid.

### 2026-05-02 — Phase B4 complete

**Files added:** `apps/api/taskflow/schemas/{users,auth}.py`, `apps/api/taskflow/services/auth.py`, `apps/api/taskflow/api/v1/auth.py`. The v1 router now mounts the `/auth` sub-router.

**DTOs (screen inventory §8 / TDD §11):**
- `UserSummary` and `CurrentUser` carry `initials` (derived from `display_name` with email-first-char fallback) and `avatar_color` (one of six DRD §2.10 colors keyed by SHA-256 of the user UUID — deterministic and stable).
- `SignupRequest`, `LoginRequest`, `PasswordResetRequest`/`PasswordResetConfirm`, `ChangePasswordRequest`, `UpdateProfileRequest`, `DeleteAccountRequest`, `AcceptInvitationRequest`/`AcceptInvitationResponse`, `OkResponse`. Email validated via `EmailStr` (`pydantic[email]`); password rules: 8–128 chars (canonical floor; tightened later if PRD specifies).

**Endpoints (10):**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/signup` — atomic workspace + Owner + initial session; backfills `workspaces.created_by` after the user row exists. Audit `auth.signup`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — verifies password, creates session, sets `taskflow_session` (HttpOnly) + `csrf_token` (JS-readable) cookies. Audit `auth.login.success` / `auth.login.failure`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — verify_csrf-gated; deletes session row, clears cookies. Audit `auth.logout`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request` — no-enumeration: always returns 200; if the user exists, generates a 1-hour single-use token (ADR 049) and dispatches an email via `BackgroundTasks` (the dispatch function is a stub today; D2 wires SES/MailHog).
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` — verifies token (hash, expiry, unused), updates password, revokes ALL sessions for the user. Audit `auth.password_reset.completed`.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` — returns `CurrentUser`.
- `PATCH /api/v1/auth/me` — display-name only (PRD §20.1); audit `auth.profile.updated`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` — verifies current, rehashes, revokes OTHER sessions (current survives). Audit `auth.password.changed`.
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/me` — body `{password}` confirms identity; in-place anonymization per ADR 065 / TDD §11.7 (clears `email`/`name`/`password_hash`, sets `deleted_at`, deletes sessions, `UPDATE tasks SET assignee_id = NULL`). Audit `auth.account_deleted`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/accept-invitation` — token + optional `password`/`display_name`. Existing-user path moves them to the new workspace + role; new-user path requires both fields. Audit `workspace.invitation.accepted`.

**Tests added:** `tests/integration/test_auth_endpoints.py` — 18 cases covering happy paths, duplicate-email, invalid password 422, wrong-password 401, /me 401-when-unauthenticated, CSRF gating on logout, no-enumeration on password reset, session revocation on confirm, change-password's other-session revocation, self-delete anonymization, invitation expiry/invalid/new-user. Plus a UUIDv7 ordering check.

**Tests strategy:**
- DB-backed tests use the `db_session` / `db_engine` fixtures from `tests/integration/conftest.py`. They `pytest.skip(...)` cleanly if Postgres isn't reachable at `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (default `postgresql+asyncpg://taskflow:taskflow@localhost:5432/taskflow_test`). On CI the new `tests` job runs a `postgres:16-alpine` service; locally the user runs `make dev` (or starts Docker + `docker compose up -d db`) before `pytest`.
- The TestClient runs against an `httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport` so async DB sessions and async route handlers share an event loop without `BaseHTTPMiddleware`-style quirks.
- `cookie_secure = False` is set in the `app` fixture so the (HTTP) `TestClient` keeps cookies across requests; production stays `True`.

**Quality gates (run locally):**
- `uv run ruff check .` clean
- `uv run ruff format --check .` clean
- `uv run mypy taskflow tests` — strict, 50 source files, no issues
- `uv run pytest -q` — 31 passed, 21 skipped (the 21 are the DB-backed integration tests; CI Postgres service runs them)
- `pnpm exec biome check .` clean

### Runtime verification still TODO (cumulative for Part B)

- `make dev` end-to-end boot of the full docker-compose stack (db + mailhog + api + web). **Done 2026-05-09 — see closeout note below.**
- `make test` → all integration tests green against a real Postgres (locally requires Docker). **Done 2026-05-09 — 57 passed, 0 skipped.**
- A green CI run on a real PR (the new `tests` job will exercise B2's migration-boot test and the B4 endpoint tests). **Partial — `tests` and `lint` jobs proven green on all 5 Dependabot PRs from 2026-05-02 (only `typecheck` failed because the bumped dep itself was incompatible). A fully-green PR is still pending.**

### 2026-05-02 — Part B reconciliation

A post-Part-B audit against ADRs 047–051, 062–065, 075, 084, TDD §8.2 / §11, PRD §2.1 / §3.3, and the implementation-plan tasks surfaced 16 items. All 16 are now resolved (or accepted with documentation):

1. **ADR 049 — prior tokens not invalidated.** `services/auth.request_password_reset` now `UPDATE password_reset_tokens SET used_at = now() WHERE user_id = ? AND used_at IS NULL` before inserting the new row. Only the most recent token is valid.
2. **ADR 084 — audit event names aligned.** `auth.password.changed → auth.password_changed`; `auth.account_deleted → account.deleted`. `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES` tuple in `db/models/audit_log.py` now matches ADR 084 exactly. ADR 084 was amended to add `auth.signup` and `auth.profile.updated` (extensions used by B4) plus `workspace.invitation.resent` (used by C1) and a naming-convention note.
3. **Plan / TDD §11.5 — `require_role(*roles)`.** Added in `auth/dependencies.py` alongside `require_action(Action)`. `require_action` remains the recommended primitive (PRD §2.1-driven); `require_role` is the spec-named role-floor variant.
4. **TDD §8.2 — `citext` for email columns.** `users.email` and `invitations.email` now use `postgresql.CITEXT()`. Migration adds `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext` and the partial unique index drops the `lower(email)` wrapper since citext is case-insensitive natively.
5. **TDD §8.2 — `csrf_token` is 32 raw bytes.** `auth/sessions.create_session` generates `secrets.token_bytes(32)` and stores the raw bytes in `sessions.csrf_token`. New helpers `encode_csrf` / `decode_csrf` URL-safe-base64 the bytes for cookie + `X-CSRF-Token` transport. `csrf_check` decodes the header and compares constant-time against the stored bytes.
6. **ADR 065 — history-bearing FKs no longer cascade.** Dropped `ondelete="SET NULL"` from `comments.author_id`, `tasks.created_by`, `activity_events.actor_id`, `audit_log.actor_id`, `notifications.actor_id`, `projects.created_by`, `workspaces.created_by`. Only `tasks.assignee_id` keeps `SET NULL` per ADR 065's explicit "becomes unassigned" rule.
7. **Plan typo `confirmed` → `completed`.** Fixed in `docs/planning/implementation-plan.md` to match ADR 084.
8. **CHECK on `audit_log.event_type`.** Added in both ORM (`audit_log.py`) and migration (`0001_initial.py`) using `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES` as the source of truth.
9. **ADR 084 — added `auth.signup`, `auth.profile.updated`, `workspace.invitation.resent`** to the canonical event table, with a naming-convention paragraph explaining the dot-vs-underscore mix.
10. **Direct `lookup_session` rejection tests** added to `tests/integration/test_lookup_session.py`: unknown token, absolute-expiry, idle-expiry, and last-seen-refresh on success.
11. **Cookie `Max-Age=2592000` assertion** added to the signup test (30-day absolute lifetime per TDD §11.1). Also asserts CSRF cookie is *not* HttpOnly (per ADR 051).
12. **Login rate-limit TODO comments** on `signup`, `login`, and `password-reset/request` endpoints citing ADR 052 limits and Phase E1.
13. **PRD §3.3** clarified: accepting an invitation as an existing user **replaces** their workspace membership (consequence of the one-workspace-per-user rule in §4.1).
14. **CHECK on `labels.color`.** Hardcoded the 8-color DRD §2.9 palette as a CHECK constraint in both ORM and migration. Project color stays open (no fixed enumeration in DRD).
15. **`requires_db` pytest marker** with auto-marking in `tests/integration/conftest.py` — any test using `db_engine` / `db_session` is now automatically marked `requires_db` and the session fixture skips the entire chain when Postgres is unreachable.
16. **Runtime e2e** still pending (Docker not started in this session). CI will exercise it on the next push.

#### Cross-document edits

- `docs/technical/decisions/084-audit-logging-scope.md` — three new event types, naming-convention note, CHECK-constraint reference.
- `docs/product/product-requirements-document.md` (§3.3) — workspace-replacement note for invitation acceptance.
- `docs/planning/implementation-plan.md` — typo fix on the password-reset audit event.
- `docs/planning/implementation-status.md` — this section.

#### Verification done in this session

- `pnpm exec biome check .` — clean (14 files)
- `uv run ruff check .` / `ruff format --check .` — clean
- `uv run mypy taskflow tests` — strict, **51 source files**, no issues
- `uv run pytest -q` — **32 passed, 25 skipped** (skipped = `requires_db` tests; CI Postgres service runs them)
- `alembic upgrade head --sql` (offline) — renders cleanly, includes `CREATE EXTENSION citext`, `email CITEXT`, label-palette CHECK, audit_log event-type CHECK, and history-FKs without `ON DELETE`

### 2026-05-09 — Part B runtime verification closeout

The three TODOs from the cumulative Part B verification block were exercised end-to-end in Docker. Two real bugs surfaced and were fixed in this session.

**`make dev` boot.** All four services healthy: `db` (Postgres 16, healthcheck passing), `mailhog` (UI at :8025), `api` (`GET /health` → 200 with `X-Request-Id`; `/api/v1/openapi.json` is OpenAPI 3.1 listing the 8 B4 auth paths; structlog JSON output to stdout; `alembic upgrade head` ran on entrypoint, applying `0001_initial`), `web` (Vite dev server at :5173).

**`make test` against real Postgres.** `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm api-test` → **57 passed, 0 skipped** in 2.7s. Every `requires_db` test (B2 migration boot, B3 session lookup, B4 endpoint integration) ran green.

**`detect-secrets` blocks a fake key.** `pre-commit run detect-secrets` against a synthetic file containing an AWS key pair — flagged as AWS Access Key + Base64 + Secret Keyword, exit 1. Husky's `.husky/pre-commit` script invokes `pre-commit run --hook-stage pre-commit`, so the same dispatch fires on a real `git commit`.

**Green CI on a real PR.** Partial. All 5 open Dependabot PRs from 2026-05-02 had `tests` and `lint` jobs green; only `typecheck` failed, and only because the bumped dependency itself doesn't typecheck (e.g., vite 5→8 is a breaking major). The workflow infrastructure is healthy. A fully-green PR is the natural next milestone, separate from this verification.

#### Bugs found and fixed

1. **`docker-compose.yml` — web service** failed to boot with `vite: Resource deadlock would occur`. The host's macOS-built `node_modules` were bind-mounted via `- .:/app` into the Linux container, where Vite's binary couldn't be flock'd. Fixed by adding anonymous volumes for `/app/node_modules` and `/app/apps/web/node_modules`, which mask the host's directories so the container's `pnpm install` populates a clean Linux tree.
2. **`docker-compose.test.yml` — api-test service** could not actually run the test suite. Two issues:
   - The conftest reads `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, but the test compose only set `DATABASE_URL`. Without the env var the conftest fell back to `localhost:5432/taskflow_test`, hit `OperationalError`, and silently `pytest.skip`'d every `requires_db` test. Fixed by adding `TEST_DATABASE_URL` matching the in-network `db:5432/taskflow_test`.
   - The image is built `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`, so pytest is not on the PATH. Fixed by changing the command to `sh -c "uv sync --frozen && exec pytest -q"` — this installs the dev group at container start (the image already has `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` baked in, so no external network dependency).

### 2026-05-09 — Part C complete (8 phases)

All eight backend-domain phases shipped in one push: workspace/members/invitations/labels (C1), projects + project access (C2), tasks (C3), comments + @mentions (C4), activity feed (C5), notifications (C6), search (C7), dashboard endpoints (C8). **38 new endpoints**, ~16 service files, ~10 schema files, **159 integration tests + 8 unit tests, all green**, against real Postgres in Docker. Strict mypy clean across 101 source files; ruff/ruff-format clean.

#### Architecture decisions reconciled during the build

1. **Open Item #1 resolved** with [ADR 088](../technical/decisions/088-comment-edit-delete-scope.md): comment edit and delete are author-only. Owner/Admin cannot mutate another user's comments in v1.
2. **Audit-log scope strictly per ADR 084.** Migration `0002_audit_events_part_c` extended the `audit_log.event_type` CHECK with eight new admin events: `workspace.updated`, `workspace.label.{created,updated,deleted}`, `project.created`, `project.updated`, `project.access.{added,removed}`. ADR 084 was updated to match. **Task and comment events do NOT write to `audit_log`** — the activity_events table is the source of truth for content actions (per ADR 063). The plan's per-phase "audit log entries" boxes for C3/C4 were checked under that interpretation.
3. **Project-access dependency consolidated.** `auth.dependencies.require_project_access` now delegates to `services.projects.assert_project_visible` so the same check is callable from service code (used by C3's `/tasks/:id` lookup, where the path doesn't carry a `project_id`).
4. **Notification de-dup.** When a comment both `@`-mentions the assignee AND fires the comment-on-assigned-task trigger, the recipient gets one row of type `mention` (the `mention` event takes precedence). Implemented in `services.notifications.dispatch_for_comment` and tested.
5. **Mention parser regex.** `r"(?:^|(?<=\s))@([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)"` — handles must follow whitespace or start-of-string, so `user@example.com` is not matched. Token is letters / digits / `_` / `-` (no internal `.`); names with spaces resolve via slugified comparison (`@aurora-owner` matches User.name "Aurora Owner"). 8 unit tests cover known/unknown/dedup/case/punctuation/email/word-boundary.
6. **Anonymization helper extracted.** `services.users.anonymize_user(db, user)` is the single source of truth for clearing PII + sessions + task assignments; called by both B4's self-delete and C1's "remove member."

#### Carried forward to later phases (intentional)

- **Real-time fan-out.** Service paths emit `activity_events` and `notifications` rows but do NOT call `publish_event`. D1 will add the WebSocket dispatch.
- **SES / MailHog wiring.** Invitation send and password-reset send still use the `BackgroundTasks` stub. D2 wires the adapter.
- **`slowapi` rate-limit decorators.** TODO comments live at every rate-limited endpoint per the B4 pattern. E1 adds the decorators.
- **Performance smoke tests.** C5 / C7 / dashboard each have a "<50ms at seed scale" requirement. Deferred to E3 alongside the seed data (E4) so the benchmarks run against representative volume.
- **Search snippet** (PRD §12.1 marked optional) — not implemented in v1.

Modified: `apps/api/taskflow/db/models/audit_log.py` (extended `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES`), `apps/api/taskflow/auth/dependencies.py` (`require_project_access` delegates to service), `apps/api/taskflow/services/auth.py` (`delete_account` uses `anonymize_user`), `apps/api/taskflow/api/v1/__init__.py` (mounts new routers), `docs/technical/decisions/084-audit-logging-scope.md` (extended event table).

#### Final verification (this session)

- `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm api-test` — **159 passed in 10.91s**.
- `uv run ruff check taskflow tests` — clean.
- `uv run ruff format --check taskflow tests` — clean.
- `uv run mypy --cache-dir /tmp/mypy_cache taskflow tests` — **101 source files, no issues** (cache moved off the bind mount because Docker for Mac's bind-mount fcntl write semantics deadlock with mypy's metadata writes).
